    m_Localized: What we currently know of pottery techniques at the time suggests
      that the rattle was baked in a two-part mold.

      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 164933341184
    m_Localized: 'The inside of the mold is first covered with clay, by hand. Using
      the spoon on your left, move some clay from the bucket on your right into this
      half of the mold.

'
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 188467580928
    m_Localized: The clay is spread by hand on the walls of the mold. Repeat the
      operation for the other half.

    m_Localized: Once both halves are covered, the clay marble is pierced with a
      wooden needle.

  - m_Id: 3086752616448
    m_Localized: The assembly is then placed inside a slit on one of the halves of
      the mold. Place it on the half you want.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 3091336990720
    m_Localized: The two-part mold is then closed, needle still sticking out, and
      cooked. Select the mold to send it off to the furnace.

  - m_Id: 3095866839040
    m_Localized: It is important that the ball remain isolated from the clay covering
      the walls of the mold, so that both harden separately. This is why a needle
      is driven through the ball.

    m_Localized: 'Once the clay has hardened, both halves of the mold are removed.
      Select the halves and slide them away from the rattle.
